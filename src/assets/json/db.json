It should ideally have a little bit of everything to make your formal look a truly distinctive one. Here are a few tips on how you can style your formal wear",

                    "p2": "Belt:A thin belt accentuates any woman's figure, so it's essential for you to choose a slim one that is in a contrast colour from your outfit. The belt and shoe rule that is a must for men doesn't usually apply for women, though. ",
